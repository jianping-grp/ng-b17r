## 1. About Bioactivity-explorer

Bioactivity-explorer a web application for interactive visualization and exploration of 
large-scale bioactivity data in [ChEMBL database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/). We built it not
intend to be a substitution of the official ChEMBL web site, but a extensive use of ChEMBL 
by discovering patterns in large-scale bioactivity data, and provides intuitive visualization 
of bioactivity data. We have open sourced Bioactivity-explorer, user who interest in building their 
own local version or getting involved in developing can found both the frontend and the backend at our 
github repository(https://github.com/jianping-grp/ng-b17r and https://github.com/jianping-grp/b17r).
