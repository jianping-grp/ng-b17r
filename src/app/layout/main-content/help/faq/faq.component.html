          <b>1. What is target network?</b>
          <br/>
          A edge in target network denotes that the two targets linked by it shared above a certain number of
          active compounds, here the activity threshold and the shared number are tunable. By default Bioactivity-explorer
          will set default thresholds according to the size of network.

          <b>2. What is scaffold activity?</b>
          <br/>
          In the first, scaffold here means BM scaffold (Bemis, G. W., & Murcko, M. A. (1996), dio: 10.1021/jm9602928).
          And the scaffold activity of a target is aggregated (mean, maximum, minimum and median) from the activities of
          all molecules that active against the
          target and belong to the scaffold.

          <br/>
          A edge in target network denotes that the two targets linked by it shared above a certain number of
          active scaffolds, here the activity threshold and the shared number are tunable. By default Bioactivity-explorer

          <b>4. How to view corresponding data of a chart?</b>
          <br/>
          On the assay type, activity type, publication and molecule properties histogram charts, double click your
          interest part (eg. the number rotate bonds bar of 4, or all 56 publications of Tyrosine-protein kinase ABL in
          2013)
          will navigate to corresponding data table.

          <b>5. What are related molecules?</b>
          <br/>
          Related molecules are a set molecules that shared more than 5 active targets with current molecule.

          <br/>
          Bioactibity-explorer was only test on the latest version of browser, so please try the latest browser (google
          chrome
          , firefox, etc) if you have any display problems.
